# Introduction to Probabilistic Programming for Scientific Discovery

Course material for the *introduction to probabilistic programming for scientific discovery* held at the Lviv Data Science Summer School

## Structure

The course is structured into 4 lectures of 90 minutes presentation time each with 2 coding tutorials for self-paced consumption.
Further reading material and references to relevant papers are provided in the respective lectures and tutorials.

*This course is based on the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language. If you have not yet worked with Julia, I'd highly encourage you to take a quick look at a tutorial, such as [this one](https://github.com/oschulz/julia-course) or the ones offered by the [JuliaAcademy](https://juliaacademy.com/courses).*
